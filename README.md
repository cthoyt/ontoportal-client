A client to BioPortal and other OntoPortal instances.

## üí™ Getting Started

One of several OntoPortal clients can be instantiated and
accessed with the same API:

```python
from ontoportal_client import BioPortalClient

bioportal_client = BioPortalClient()
ontologies = bioportal_client.get_ontologies()
```

Complete documentation can be found on [ontoportal-client.readthedocs.io](https://ontoportal-client.readthedocs.io/)

## üöÄ Installation

```shell
$ pip install ontoportal_client
```

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/ontoportal-client.git
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration of the API tokens for for each of the clients is mediated by
[`pystow`](https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow). Using BioPortal as an example,
you can either:

1. Pass the API key in the construtor of the client class
2. Set the `BIOPORTAL_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Create a file `~/.config/bioportal.ini` and set the `api_key` value under
   the `[bioportal]` section.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

<details>
  <summary>See developer instructions</summary>


The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### Development Installation

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/ontoportal-client.git
$ cd ontoportal-client
$ pip install -e .
```

### ü•º Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cthoyt/ontoportal-client/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üìñ Building the Documentation

The documentation can be built locally using the following:

```shell
$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/ontoportal-client.git
$ cd ontoportal-client
$ tox -e docs
$ open docs/build/html/index.html
``` 

The documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs`
extra specified in the [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). `sphinx` plugins
like `texext` can be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the
`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within the `finish` environment
in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg`,
   `src/ontoportal_client/version.py`, and [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel using [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)
3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine). Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this
   step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by minor, you can
   use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.
